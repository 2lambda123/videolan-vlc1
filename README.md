# VLC Media Player: Play Everything, Everywhere

**VLC** is not just a media player; it's a versatile, open-source multimedia engine. It's designed with one mission: to play everything, everywhere.

With **VLC**, you can effortlessly handle a wide range of multimedia files, discs, streams, and devices. It goes beyond mere playback; it can convert, encode, stream, and manipulate content into various formats.

This powerful tool finds its users across the globe, serving diverse purposes on numerous platforms.

If you need to integrate this engine into your own applications, look no further than *libVLC*.

**VLC** is a proud member of the [VideoLAN project](https://videolan.org), and its development is fostered by a dedicated community of volunteers.

The VideoLAN project began at [Ã‰cole Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) when VLC was relicensed under the GPLv2 license in February 2001. Since then, it has been downloaded billions of times.

## Licensing

**VLC** is distributed under the GPLv2 *(or later)* license. On certain platforms, it effectively operates under GPLv3 due to dependencies.

For those interested in integrating the engine into third-party applications, **libVLC** is available under the LGPLv2 *(or later)* license, allowing flexibility in licensing for embedded use.
